# 2022 Day 1

```clojure
^{:nextjournal.clerk/visibility {:code :hide}}
(ns aoc-notebooks.solutions.2022.d1
  (:require [aoc-notebooks.input :as input]))
```

[Problem](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)

## Part 1

Using our input helper library, we can pull out groups of lines seperated by blank lines, each corresponding to an elf, and parse the numbers on those lines.

```clojure
(def groups (map input/numbers (input/line-groups 2022 1)))
```

Next we remove some unnecessary nesting to give a simple representation of each elf's intake.

```clojure
(def elf-counts (map flatten groups))
```

Then define a sum function, apply it to each elf's counts to get each elf's intake.

```clojure
(defn sum [nums] (reduce + nums))
(def elf-intakes (map sum elf-counts))
```

Finally find the maximum for the answer to part 1.

```clojure
(apply max elf-intakes)
```

## Part 2

For part 2 we need the top 3. Given the data we already have, the laziest way to do this is to sort and take the last 3 elements from the sorted list as the top 3.
This is trivial to do in Clojure.

```clojure
(def elf-intakes-sorted (sort elf-intakes))
```

```
(sum (take-last 3 elf-intakes-sorted))
```

More efficient solutions exist but it's day 1, this will do the job easily.
